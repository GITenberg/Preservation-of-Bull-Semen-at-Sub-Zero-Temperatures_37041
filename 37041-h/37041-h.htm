<p>The first announcement in 1951 of the successful impregnation
of a cow with bull semen that had been frozen stimulated
much interest and research in freezing as a method of preserving
bull semen. Research during the years following 1951 resulted in
considerable progress and success in using freezing as a means of
holding semen for long periods of time without loss of fertility.</p>

<p>Between 1952 and 1957, research on many aspects of the preservation
of bull semen at sub-zero temperatures was carried out in the
Department of Dairy Science at the University of Illinois. Many of
these investigations have aided in perfecting the freezing technique
that has been adapted for practical use. Some of these findings have
been published, but many items have gone unreported except for general
references at scientific meetings.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this bulletin to bring together the results of
several experiments carried out in connection with the freezing of bull
semen and to present a practical freezing procedure based on the
results of these experiments and findings at other institutions. Persons
interested in the development of the procedures and the reasons why
certain steps are necessary in freezing semen will find the details in
the first part of this bulletin. Those interested only in the freezing
procedure may turn to page 35 where a practical method of freezing
semen is described.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch1" id="Ch1"></a>EARLY WORK ON FREEZING SEMEN</h2>

<p>While it has been known for a long time that various types of
tissues and organisms can withstand freezing and are even preserved
by freezing, the first attempts at freezing sperm cells were made before
the turn of the century. In 1897, Davenport<a name="FNanchor1" id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <a name="FNanchorB" id="FNanchorB"></a><a href="#FootnoteB" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
found that human sperm
would withstand freezing. For thirty to forty years after that, little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
attention was paid to freezing as a possible means of preserving semen.
An excellent review of the early attempts to freeze sperm has been
assembled by Polge and Parkes.<a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
These investigators also gave a good account of their work at the British National Institute of Medical
Research in London, where in 1949 they demonstrated that glycerol
would protect fowl sperm so that it would survive freezing. The next
year they found that bull sperm and the sperm of several other species
were protected by glycerol during freezing. During the same year,
Emmens and Blackshaw<a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><a name="FNanchor3" id="FNanchor3"></a> showed
that ram and bull sperm would survive freezing. In 1951 frozen semen was used to produce a calf in
England and a lamb in Australia.</p>

<p>The highlights in the development of frozen semen have been
covered by other reviews and reports. Interested persons will find the
articles of Polge and Parkes<a href="#Footnote2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Smith<a name="FNanchor4" id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> especially good on the early
history and theoretical aspects of freezing sperm. Later progress on
the freezing procedure has been reviewed and covered in a number of
detailed reports.<a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5],</a>
<a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6],</a>
<a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Many items not covered in those articles have
been assembled here.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch2" id="Ch2"></a>SELECTION OF SEMEN FOR FREEZING</h2>


<p>One of the first considerations in freezing semen is that of deciding
which semen samples are to be frozen. Since preservation of the
semen&mdash;the maintenance of the potential motility and especially the
fertility of the sperm&mdash;is the primary aim, some attention should be
directed to the kind of semen sample that will withstand freezing. Do
the initial characteristics of the sample indicate whether the sperm will
withstand freezing? Does maturity of the sperm affect their freezability?</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_1" id="Sec2_1"></a><b>Predicting freezability.</b> Estimates of semen quality in the past have
been based in part on the numbers of sperm present in a fresh sample
and on the percentage and rate of motility shown by the sperm. These
characteristics were used to determine the relationship between the
original concentration of sperm (in the fresh, undiluted sample), the
percentage and rate of sperm motility in the diluted samples just prior
to freezing, and the percentage and rate of sperm motility following
freezing and thawing. From data collected before and after freezing
and thawing 54 ejaculates, it was found that there was not a significant
correlation between the number of sperm present in the original sample
and the percent of motile sperm present after freezing and thawing
(r = 0.03). A highly significant correlation (r = 0.45) was found,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
however, between the percentages before freezing and after thawing.
While this correlation coefficient was highly significant, its magnitude
indicates that only about one fifth of the variation in percentage of
motile sperm observed after freezing was accounted for by the motility
of the sperm prior to freezing.</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_2" id="Sec2_2"></a><b>Freezability of first and second ejaculates.</b> In the early days of
artificial breeding in this country, it was commonly believed that a
second ejaculate collected a few minutes after the first resulted in a
larger ejaculate containing more sperm. With the development of the
procedure of stimulating sexual excitement by restraint prior to collecting
semen, this difference between first and second ejaculates has
been greatly reduced. Still it was noted that second ejaculates frequently
withstood freezing better than first ejaculates, even though
restraint and stimulation of the bull occurred prior to collection of the
first ejaculate. During the course of a number of experiments, it was
possible to compare the freezability of 2 ejaculates that were collected
a few minutes apart from the same bull. Two consecutive ejaculates
were obtained one or more times from 24 bulls so that a total of 58
comparisons could be made. The mean prefreezing and post-thawing
percentages of motile sperm in first and second ejaculates are presented
in <a href="#Tab1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>An analysis of variance showed that in this comparison the differences
between first and second ejaculates in sperm survival during
freezing were highly significant. A later comparison of 27 first and
second ejaculates from 26 bulls did not show as great a difference between

<p>In general, the motility before freezing improved slightly from the
first to the fourth to sixth ejaculate and then declined until about the
12th or 14th ejaculate, at which point the prefreezing motility seemed
to level off through the 20th ejaculate (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The percentage of
motile sperm found after freezing and thawing followed the same
trend at an average level 10 to 15 percent lower than the prefreezing
level. As is readily seen from the trend lines in <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>, the difference
between the prefreezing motility and the post-thawing motility increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
gradually after about the fifth ejaculate. Although the absolute
difference did not increase greatly, the percentage of survival after
freezing dropped from 81 percent on the first 5 ejaculates to 26.5 percent
on the last 5 (<a href="#Tab2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Sec2_4" id="Sec2_4"></a><b>Freezability of epididymal sperm.</b> Since the freezability of bull
semen seemed to be better in second than in first ejaculates and some
improvement in freezability was evident through the first 4 to 6 ejaculates
taken consecutively, the question of whether epididymal sperm
would withstand freezing seemed to be important. Although when 20
collections were made, the later ejaculates no doubt contained fewer
mature sperm, the lowered freezability could have been due to accessory
gland secretions rather than changes in the sperm themselves.
Removing sperm directly from the epididymis would eliminate any
effect that the accessory gland secretions could be exerting. Further,
if epididymal sperm could be frozen, obtaining and using semen from
a bull shortly after his death should be possible.</p>

<p>To determine whether epididymal sperm would withstand freezing,
the 12 epididymides (cauda only) of 6 slaughtered bulls were flushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with saline (0.9 percent) and the sperm obtained were frozen using
the same procedure as was used with the 20 consecutive ejaculates
discussed earlier. Averages of the 2 epididymides from each bull are
given in <a href="#Tab3">Table 3</a>; the samples from bulls 5 and 6 were combined. From
the data in <a href="#Tab3">Table 3</a>, it is obvious that motile sperm were present after
freezing and thawing epididymal samples. It is likely that further
experience in handling epididymal sperm may lead to improved results.
Using frozen epididymal sperm from 2 bulls, Canadian workers have
produced confirmed pregnancies in 8 out of 12 cows.<a name="FNanchor8" id="FNanchor8"></a><a

<p><a name="Sec2_5" id="Sec2_5"></a><b>Freezability of washed sperm.</b> In the laboratory it is frequently
desirable to study sperm free of the seminal plasma in which they are
ejaculated. Sperm can be separated from the seminal plasma by centrifugation,
removal of the supernatant plasma, and resuspension in a
salt solution of known composition. Sometimes it is desirable to repeat
the process. This tends to wash the sperm with the salt solution
and sperm handled in this way are called washed sperm.</p>

<p>Sperm cells centrifuged three times and washed twice in 0.9 percent
sodium chloride solution withstood freezing well when finally
resuspended and frozen in yolk-citrate diluent. The percentage of survival
in three samples subjected to this treatment was 60 percent. Thus
it appears that the seminal plasma itself is not essential for ejaculated
sperm to survive the rigors of freezing. This is not surprising, since it
had already been found that epididymal sperm, which also are free of
accessory gland secretions, can withstand freezing and thawing.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch3" id="Ch3"></a>EXTENDERS FOR FREEZING BULL SEMEN</h2>

<p>Both of the extenders that are widely used in routine storage of
bull semen at 5&deg; C. are used for freezing semen. These are the egg
yolk-sodium citrate and whole or skimmilk extenders. Most of the
research with extenders for freezing bull semen in this laboratory has
been done with the yolk-citrate diluents.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_1" id="Sec3_1"></a><b>Proportion of egg yolk in the final diluent.</b> Some early experiences
with a diluent consisting of one part yolk and one part 2.9 percent
sodium citrate dihydrate in distilled water showed poor sperm survival
following freezing. The final mixture with this diluent consisted of
about 45 percent yolk. In other attempts at adding glycerol in order
to freeze semen, the final proportion of yolk was diminished and better
sperm survival was obtained. Several experiments were carried out to
test the effect of varying levels of egg yolk.</p>

<p>In the first efforts to find the optimum level of egg yolk, the level<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of yolk in the final frozen mixture was varied from about 6 to 46
percent. These levels were obtained by varying the proportion of yolk
to 2.9 percent citrate solution in the original extending media and also
in the media added in glycerolating the samples.</p>

<p>Split portions of 20 semen samples were frozen in each of the
extender combinations indicated in <a href="#Tab4">Table 4</a>. The mean percentages of
motile sperm found before and after freezing and thawing are shown
also. The highest percentages were found with extenders containing
23 and 24 percent yolk. The highest percentage of yolk, resulting when
a 1:1 (yolk to citrate) extender was used for both extending and
glycerolating, proved to be most detrimental to sperm survival during
freezing. The lowest percentage of yolk used (6 percent) was not
as effective in protecting sperm during freezing as the intermediate
levels tested (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Since rather large changes in the percentages of yolk were used

citrate percentages held constant. In these tests, 16 and 24 percent
yolk maintained sperm better at all citrate levels tried than 32 percent
yolk. The 16 percent level was slightly better at most of the levels of
citrate tested (<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_2" id="Sec3_2"></a><b>Citrate level in the final diluent.</b> The early work of the British

satisfactory for freezing bull sperm. Later, in a personal communication,
Polge of the British group suggested that a citrate level of about
2.35 percent might be best with a final glycerol concentration of 7
percent. Some of the first attempts in this laboratory at establishing
the optimum yolk-to-citrate ratios are shown in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>. In these experiments,
the optimum levels of citrate appeared to be lower than
anticipated from the British work. Thus a more complex experiment
was set up to test a wider range of citrate levels using 16 and 24
percent egg yolk in the final freezing mixture. The average percentages
of motile sperm found after freezing 10 semen samples at each of the
citrate and yolk levels in this experiment are shown also in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>.
Little difference in freezability was found between citrate percentages
of 1.55 and 1.95. When the rate of sperm motility following freezing
and thawing was considered along with the percent of motile sperm,
a slight advantage was found with 16 percent yolk and a citrate concentration
of 1.55 percent.</p>

stored in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator at -15&deg; C. Upon
thawing, it was whitish in color and more viscous than freshly prepared

favorably with freshly prepared diluent for freezing semen.</p>

<p><a name="Sec3_4" id="Sec3_4"></a><b>Other diluents.</b> Without the protective action of egg yolk or milk,
few bull sperm will survive freezing. Several diluents were compared

best in maintaining sperm motility during freezing. Yolk-phosphate

<h2><a name="Ch4" id="Ch4"></a>DILUTION RATES</h2>


<p>The first trials by the British at freezing bull semen were made
with samples containing many millions of sperm cells. In routine
artificial breeding, it is common to add extenders to semen so that
one milliliter of diluted semen may contain only 10 million living
sperm cells. (This number still insures optimal fertility.) Frequently
the addition of 100 or more parts of the yolk extender to each part of
the original semen sample is possible without reducing the sperm
numbers below 10 million per milliliter. No one knew if this process
of dilution would affect the resistance of bull sperm to freezing. The
effect of various rates of dilution on the freezability of bull sperm
was tested with 10 semen samples. The results, presented in <a href="#Tab6">Table 6</a>,
show that the numbers of sperm between 10 and 90 million per
milliliter did not influence the percentage of sperm that survived
freezing.</p>

<p>In a later trial it was found that sperm survival was slightly better
at lower dilution rates than in the same samples frozen following
dilution to 15 million sperm per milliliter. However, field trials with
frozen semen carried out by others, using sperm numbers as low as
15 million per milliliter of semen inseminated or even lower, have been
highly satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor11" id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11],</a>
<a name="FNanchor12" id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>During the early studies in the Illinois laboratory, the effects of
glycerol level were also tested.<a name="FNanchor13" id="FNanchor13"></a><a
href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> These effects are discussed in the
section on <a href="#Ch5">glycerol additions</a> beginning on <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>.</p>

Under some circumstances it might be advantageous to freeze semen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with a high concentration of sperm cells and then extend it further
after thawing. With such a procedure less storage space is needed
than when dilution is carried to the maximum before freezing. Two
experiments were conducted to test the effects of dilution and storage
at 5&deg; C. and dilution and refreezing following an initial freezing of
concentrated samples.</p>

<p>From <a href="#Tab7">Table 7</a> it can be seen that refreezing following an initial

freezing was more detrimental to the portion of the samples extended
to 15 million sperm per milliliter than to the portion that was refrozen
at a higher sperm concentration. The percentage of motile sperm
remained fairly high in the portions that were diluted to 15 million

<hr class="c25" />
<h2><a name="Ch5" id="Ch5"></a>GLYCEROL ADDITIONS</h2>


<p>When the British procedure for freezing bull semen was first tried
in this country, many of the refinements of the technique still had not
been defined. It was known that glycerol worked well in protecting
sperm during freezing. The effects of glycerol on sperm at 5&deg; C., the
appropriate levels to use in freezing, and the manner of adding it were
not well established. Therefore, a number of trials were conducted in
an attempt to establish the best procedures.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_1" id="Sec5_1"></a><b>Effect of glycerol on sperm survival at 5&deg; C.</b> Since early work
indicated the need for adding glycerol to diluted semen in order to
protect the sperm during freezing, it was considered important to
determine the levels of glycerol that sperm would tolerate at 5&deg; C.
Ten semen samples were extended 1:9 (semen to diluent) in a 1:1
yolk-citrate diluent (yolk to 2.9 percent sodium citrate dihydrate).
Each sample was then split into 6 portions and an equal volume of
citrate solution containing glycerol was added slowly to each to bring
the glycerol in the final mixture to 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 percent (by
volume). These samples were stored at 5&deg; C. and examined for
motile sperm after 1, 3, and 7 days. The effects of glycerol levels on
the percentage of sperm surviving and the rate (or speed) of their
forward motion (0 = no forward motion; 4 = extremely rapid progressive
motility) are presented in <a href="#Tab8">Table 8</a>.</p>

<p>The percentage of motile sperm decreased slightly at the higher
levels of glycerol. The most noticeable effect of the increase in glycerol
level was the reduction in the rate of forward motion of the sperm.
At the 30-percent level, the sperm moved slowly and could be seen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rotate as they moved forward. Some samples were checked after
slowly bringing the diluent up to a level of 40 percent glycerol; the
sperm seemed to be immobilized completely in this solution.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_2" id="Sec5_2"></a><b>Glycerol levels for freezing semen.</b> The British procedure called
for the use of 10 percent glycerol in the final mixture of semen and
extender prior to freezing. Yet, as shown in <a href="#Tab6">Table 6</a>, in our laboratory
5 percent glycerol resulted in the survival of a higher percentage of
sperm than did 10 or 15 percent. In order to define more clearly the
optimum glycerol level, several ejaculates of semen were subsampled
and portions were frozen after the addition of yolk-citrate extender
and glycerol in varying quantities. From <a href="#Tab9">Table 9</a> it can be seen that
glycerol levels of 6 and 8 percent in the final mixture resulted in maximum
sperm survival during freezing. These results were confirmed in
tests on the survival of sperm at 5&deg; C. storage for 3 days following
freezing and thawing with varying glycerol levels (see <a href="#Tab10">Table 10</a>).</p>

<p>The results shown in <a href="#Tab9">Tables 9</a> and <a href="#Tab10">10</a> were confirmed also in later
experiments. Thirty-six samples were subjected to various levels of
glycerol and no significant difference in freezability was found between
6 and 8 percent. Based on these findings, a glycerol level of 7
percent was adopted for use in all experiments described in this bulletin,
unless otherwise indicated. Results in a number of other laboratories
have agreed with our findings regarding the use of approximately
7 percent glycerol with the yolk-citrate diluent.<a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5],</a>

<p><a name="Sec5_3" id="Sec5_3"></a><b>Rate, temperature, and method of adding glycerol.</b> Closely associated
with the question of how much glycerol should be added is that
of how the additions should be made. Originally it was believed that
the glycerol should be added in stages so that changes would occur
gradually. However, there would be a saving in time if the entire
amount could be added at once. Also, if the glycerol addition could be
made soon after the dilution with egg yolk-citrate extender at room
temperature, time would be gained in processing the semen for use.
Since aging <i>in vitro</i> is known to reduce the fertilizing ability of sperm,
every effort should be made to keep the processing time at a minimum.
The results of an experiment involving these items, along with that of
how much time should be allowed after the additions before freezing
(equilibration time), are presented in <a href="#Tab11">Table 11</a>. One can see that sperm
survived freezing better when the diluted semen was cooled to 4.5&deg; C.
before the glycerol was added. The survival at 10&deg; and 15.5&deg; C. was<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reduced with each rise in temperature. Thus, it appears that cooling to
refrigerator temperature (4-5&deg; C.) before adding the glycerol should
be a part of the routine procedure.</p>

<p>A comparison of the results from adding the glycerol in 5, 3, and
1 equal portions is given also in <a href="#Tab11">Table 11</a>. Little difference in survival
during freezing was noted between the three rates of addition. Using
3 equal additions resulted in slightly better results, but the advantage
was not statistically significant. While little difference was evident
from adding the glycerol in 3 portions as compared to 1, many still
use 3 additions in the hope of obtaining a slightly better sperm survival.
In fact, some have gone to a procedure of adding the glycerol
dropwise with constant gentle agitation. This method has not been
tested in this laboratory.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_4" id="Sec5_4"></a><b>Allowing sperm to equilibrate with the glycerol.</b> Allowing sperm
to stand in the presence of glycerol is considered by some to be necessary
in order that the glycerol penetrate the sperm heads before
freezing. From the first successful attempts at freezing bull sperm
came the practice of allowing 12 to 20 hours for this process of
equilibration. A long equilibration time results in aging the sperm.
Data from a number of sources indicate that a drop of approximately
5 percent in fertility in the field occurs with each 24 hours of aging in
the test tube. Thus it would seem desirable to reduce the equilibration
time to a minimum commensurate with good freezability in order to
reduce the effects of aging (at 5&deg; C.). Results of attempting to reduce
equilibration time are given in <a href="#Tab11">Table 11</a>. At 4.5&deg; C., little variation in
motility following freezing and thawing was found after equilibration
times of 2, 6, and 18 hours. At the higher temperatures of 10&deg; and
15.5&deg; C., the shortest equilibration time&mdash;2 hours&mdash;was slightly more
detrimental with the differences significant at the 5-percent level at
15.5&deg; C. For all temperatures combined, 6 hours was significantly better
than 2 or 18 hours.</p>

<p><a name="Sec5_5" id="Sec5_5"></a><b>Sugar additions and equilibration time.</b> Early in their experiences
in freezing semen, the Australian workers found a short equilibration
time&mdash;30 minutes&mdash;to be satisfactory if sugars were added to the
diluent.<a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This protective action of sugars during the equilibration
period was confirmed in our investigations. The results of one phase
of this study are shown in <a href="#Tab12">Table 12</a>. From these data it can be seen
that the presence of glucose or rhamnose at a level of 1.25 percent
improved sperm survival during the period of equilibration. In
another trial these sugars and two others, arabinose and xylose, were
tested for their protective action in freezing semen. The percentages
of surviving sperm remaining after the various steps in the freezing
procedure with and without the presence of these sugars are shown in
<a href="#Tab13">Table 13</a>.</p>

<p>Three of the sugars&mdash;glucose, arabinose, and rhamnose&mdash;protected
the sperm during equilibration and freezing. Xylose was less
effective, but its addition resulted in slightly better sperm survival than
glycerol alone. It was found also that the methylene-blue reduction

None of these materials has been as effective as glycerol in protecting
sperm during freezing. In fact, several of the materials proved to be
injurious to sperm prior to attempts to freeze the samples. While the
work in our laboratory with these substances as glycerol substitutes

<h2><a name="Ch6" id="Ch6"></a>FREEZING RATE</h2>

<p><a name="Sec6_1" id="Sec6_1"></a><b>Effect of freezing rate on sperm survival.</b> Reports by one group
of British workers in early trials on freezing bull semen indicated that
the rate of cooling in freezing should not exceed 2&deg; C. per minute
between +5&deg; and -15&deg; C., although below -15&deg; C. the rate could
be faster. Another group expressed the view that semen could be
plunged into dry ice at -79&deg; C. after it had been cooled to -15&deg; C.
To clarify this part of the freezing procedure, 11 samples of semen
were subdivided and portions of each were frozen at rates of 0.25&deg;,
0.5&deg;, 1.0&deg;, 2.0&deg;, and 4.0&deg; C. drop per minute between +5&deg; and -20&deg;
C. and then twice these rates between -20&deg; and -79&deg; C. Vials of
each ejaculate at +5&deg; C. were also plunged directly into an alcohol
bath at -79&deg; C. The samples which were cooled at the rates of 0.25&deg;,
0.5&deg;, 1.0&deg;, 2.0&deg;, and 4.0&deg; C. per minute had the following percentages
of motile sperm after thawing: 30, 40, 46, 44, and 44. A mean of 32
percent of the sperm in the samples that were plunged directly into an
alcohol bath at -79&deg; C. were motile after thawing. There were no
statistically significant differences among the samples frozen at 1.0&deg;,
2.0&deg; or 4.0&deg; C. per minute. All of the others had significantly lower
survival rates. Thus, it is obvious that too slow a cooling rate and
plunging the samples directly into a -79&deg; C. bath from a temperature
of +5&deg; C. cause greater harm to the sperm than cooling at a rate
between 1.0&deg; and 4.0&deg; C. per minute.</p>

<p>Some investigators have suggested that rapid cooling below -20&deg;
C. is not detrimental to frozen semen. This idea was tested in conjunction
with other experiments. Twenty-five samples cooled slowly (2&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
C. per minute to -28&deg; C., then 4&deg; C. per minute to -79&deg; C.) showed
62 percent sperm survival compared with only 45 percent when cooled
rapidly below -28&deg; C. (2&deg; C. per minute to -28&deg; C. then plunged
into bath at -79&deg; C.). Thus, rapid cooling was detrimental even after
the critical temperature range of +5&deg; C. to -20&deg; C. had been passed.</p>

another experiment, it was shown that the volume of diluted semen

<h2><a name="Ch7" id="Ch7"></a>STORAGE TEMPERATURE</h2>

<p>In freezing and storing bull sperm, an alcohol bath containing dry
ice at a temperature of -79&deg; C. has been used as a cooling agent. In
many areas, the availability of dry ice is limited and the cost is rather
high. Mechanical means are available for obtaining temperatures as
low as, or lower than, -79&deg; C. but for the most part they are expensive.
If warmer temperatures were suitable for storing frozen semen,
the ordinary deep-freeze, which operates at -15&deg; to -25&deg; C., might
be used.</p>

<p><a name="Sec7_1" id="Sec7_1"></a><b>Storage at temperatures from -23&deg; to -79&deg; C.</b> In testing the

temperatures were maintained by dropping pieces of dry ice into ethyl
alcohol baths as needed. Samples were thawed after 1 hour, 1 day, 3
days, and 5 days. After 1 hour, the samples maintained at the various

the end of 1 day, samples stored at -79&deg; C. exhibited approximately
the same motility as did similar samples stored for 1 hour. The
samples stored at -65&deg; C. had declined slightly in motility and those
maintained at -51&deg; C. had only one-third the motility which they had
displayed at 1 hour. The samples at -23&deg; and -37&deg; C. exhibited
practically no motility after 1 day in storage. After 5 days, only 3 of
the 8 ejaculates stored at -51&deg; C. showed motility upon thawing.
Apparently detrimental changes take place more rapidly when the
samples are stored at temperatures warmer than -65&deg; C. The nature
of these changes has not been determined. Reports from other laboratories
indicate that storage temperatures much lower than -79&deg; C.
are just as satisfactory as -79&deg; C.</p>

<p>No tests of the effects of storage at -79&deg; C. for periods longer
than 51 days have been conducted in this laboratory. Portions of 12
ejaculates were frozen and stored at -79&deg; C. for various periods. One
portion of each of these was examined on the second, ninth, 16th and
51st day of storage. The percent of motile sperm and rate of motility
at each of these examinations were as follows:</p>

<p>The average prefreezing motility percentage for the above samples was
58, with an average rate of motility of 2.9. It is apparent from these
results that the loss in motility was greatest due to the initial freezing,
and after that the drop was most pronounced during the first 16 days
of storage.</p>

In 1953, a report from Arkansas suggested that warmer storage temperatures

in the freezing mixture.<a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> To test the effectiveness of various glycerol
levels on protecting sperm stored at deep-freeze temperatures, glycerol
levels of 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, and 9.5 percent were used with portions of 4
semen samples. Survival in the portions frozen and stored at -20&deg; C.
was poor compared with the portions reduced and held at -79&deg; C. In
a second experiment, 4 samples were subdivided and frozen with a
final concentration of 7, 11, 15, and 19 percent glycerol in the semen-diluent
mixture. In this trial, poor results were obtained at -20&deg; C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
except that glycerol at a level of 19 percent protected the sperm more
effectively than at lower levels. Maximal survival at -79&deg; C. was
obtained at the 7-percent glycerol level. A final trial was run, using
glycerol levels of 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31 percent. The percentages

<p>While survival was fair over a short period of time with 19 percent
glycerol at -20&deg; C., deterioration was rapid during storage. After 18
hours of storage, the samples at -20&deg; C. (19 percent glycerol) contained
only one half as many motile sperm as were still present in the
samples at -79&deg; C. (7 percent glycerol). After 42 hours of storage,
the best samples at -20&deg; C. contained only one-third the number of
motile sperm still present in the samples stored at -79&deg; C. These trials
leave little doubt that under the present system of freezing and storing,
storage at ordinary deep-freeze temperatures is far inferior to
storage at dry-ice temperatures.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch8" id="Ch8"></a>THAWING</h2>


<p>The importance of carefully controlled cooling and storage has
been emphasized in the foregoing sections. The need for controlling
thawing rates and the temperature of thawing was not clearly defined
in the early work on freezing bull semen. The British used a thawing
temperature of 40&deg; C., which was satisfactory. If there is a need to
hold the semen for a time after thawing, then a lower thawing temperature
might be more desirable so that cooling again will not be
necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Sec8_1" id="Sec8_1"></a><b>Comparison of thawing temperatures of 5&deg; C. and 38&deg; C.</b> The
effects of thawing at temperatures of 38&deg; (body temperature) and
5&deg; C. (refrigerator temperature) were investigated. The first trial
involved thawing as rapidly as possible by dropping glass ampules of
frozen semen into water baths at the two temperatures. The frozen
semen samples contained glycerol levels of 4, 6, 8, and 10 percent. The
mean percentages of motile sperm found after thawing thirteen diluted
semen samples treated in this manner are shown in <a href="#Fig6">Figure 6</a>.</p>

<p>The 5&deg; C. thawing temperature resulted in a higher percentage of
sperm survival at all the glycerol levels than 38&deg; C., with the difference
in favor of 5&deg; C. becoming greater as the glycerol level increased.
The reason for the interaction between glycerol level and thawing
temperature is not known. It may be that the presence of the higher
levels of glycerol at 38&deg; C. brought about harmful metabolic activity.
The difference in survival of sperm in semen thawed at 5&deg; C. and at
38&deg; C. continued during storage at 5&deg; C. (<a href="#Tab15">Table 15</a>). It was also
evident that the interaction between glycerol level and thawing temperature

<p>It is obvious that motility falls off rapidly after the semen is
thawed. In a field trial in which the initial intent was to test the effect
of glycerol levels on fertility of frozen semen, the semen was thawed in
the morning and used during the same day. Survival of the sperm with
4 percent glycerol was so poor that only a few breedings were made
with these samples. Even at 7 and 10 percent, the fertility results were
much lower than with semen that had not been subjected to freezing.
At that time it was felt that thawing the samples and using them
throughout the day may have caused the low fertility results. Since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
then, a large-scale experiment by Cornell University investigators, in
cooperation with the New York Artificial Breeders&#8217; Cooperative, has
shown definitely that thawing should be delayed until a few minutes
prior to breeding.<a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
If the semen is used immediately, a thawing temperature
of either 5&deg; or 38&deg; C. appears to be suitable. However, there
is less danger of cold shock due to recooling if 5&deg; C is used.</p>

<p><a name="Sec8_2" id="Sec8_2"></a><b>Thawing rate in plastic and in glass.</b> Glass ampules transmit cold

occurs more rapidly in glass than in plastic ampules. The changes in
temperature that occurred when glass and plastic ampules were
thawed in a water bath at 5&deg; C. are shown in <a href="#Fig8">Figure 8</a>. The initial
temperature rise for the first minute or two was about the same, then
the rate of warming in the plastic slowed and actual melting of the
frozen sample occurred a little over a minute later in the plastic than
it did in the glass. Both were thawed in less than four minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch9" id="Ch9"></a>EFFECTS OF FREEZING PROCEDURES ON METABOLIC
ACTIVITY OF BULL SPERM</h2>

<p>By finding how methods of handling affect the sperm cells, one can
sometimes improve the procedures to avoid harmful effects. Some
attempts have been made in this laboratory to determine the effects of
the freezing procedures on the metabolic activity of bull spermatozoa.
These investigations have been limited in scope, involving the measurement
of oxygen-consumption and estimates of sperm motility during
and after incubation at 37&deg; C. in a Warburg apparatus.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_1" id="Sec9_1"></a><b>Effect of glycerol additions on oxygen uptake of diluted semen at
37&deg; C.</b> The effect of adding glycerol to diluted semen on oxygen consumption
of the sperm was tested in a Warburg apparatus, using
semen diluted with an extender consisting of one part egg yolk and one
part 2.9 percent sodium citrate dihydrate. The yolk-citrate extender
was added to the semen at a rate which brought the sperm concentration
in 0.5 milliliter to 200 million to 500 million. An exact count was
used to calculate the oxygen uptake per 10<span class="expon">8</span> sperm per hour (ZO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<p>Glycerol in various percentages in 2.9 percent sodium citrate
dihydrate solution was placed in the sidearm of the Warburg flasks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The diluted semen was held in the main compartment. After a 60-minute
preliminary run, in which the rate of oxygen uptake of the
sperm in yolk-citrate diluent was determined, the contents of the
sidearm were tipped into the main compartment. The resulting
glycerol percentages after mixing the sidearm and main compartment
contents were 0, 4, 8, and 12 percent. Ten samples of semen were
subsampled and the oxygen uptake of each was determined at all four
levels of glycerol.</p>

<p>Oxygen uptake was increasingly stimulated during the first 20-minute
interval by each increase in the amount of glycerol added
(<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>). After the first 20 minutes, the rate of oxygen utilization
decreased at the two higher levels of glycerol but persisted at 4 percent.
The rate of oxygen consumption for the first 20-minute period
at the 4-percent glycerol level was 130 percent that of the control to
which only sodium citrate had been added. At 8 and 12 percent the
values for the period were 144 and 192 percent, respectively, of the
control rate.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is known to be detrimental to sperm. The addition
of glycerol to diluted semen first increased oxygen uptake and then reduced
it. Since a reduction in sperm survival followed, some harmful
action must have taken place with the addition of glycerol at 37&deg; C. To
test whether this action could be due to the release of hydrogen peroxide
as occurs in certain bacteria, glycerol with catalase&mdash;the enzyme
which breaks down hydrogen peroxide&mdash;was added to a portion of
8 diluted semen samples and the oxygen uptake was recorded. Comparison
of the resulting oxygen uptake with glycerol and with glycerol
plus catalase is shown in <a href="#Fig11">Figure 11</a>.</p>

catalase (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>). However, the general trend in oxygen consumption
produced by the addition of glycerol was not changed greatly. The
higher levels of glycerol still stimulated oxygen uptake during the
first 20-minute period after the additions and then slowed the rate of
oxygen utilization. The rate of utilization was generally higher during
the test period in the presence of catalase than without added catalase.
It appeared that a part of the harmful effect of glycerol might be due
to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Still, the detrimental effects of
the higher levels of glycerol were not completely removed.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_3" id="Sec9_3"></a><b>Effect of freezing procedures on oxygen utilization by sperm.</b>
Limited data have been obtained on the effects of some of the freezing
procedures on the oxygen utilization of bull sperm. The results obtained
in these experiments confirmed the earlier findings that tipping
glycerol directly into the diluted semen at 37&deg; C. caused an increase in
oxygen consumption (<a href="#Tab16">Table 16</a>). All other steps in the freezing procedure
had little effect on oxygen consumption by the sperm. Except
where glycerol was added during the determination, the rate of oxygen
utilization was lower the second hour than during the first. The
oxygen uptake of semen that had been frozen and thawed seemed to
drop faster than that of unfrozen samples.</p>

<p><a name="Sec9_4" id="Sec9_4"></a><b>Effect of freezing procedures on methylene-blue reduction time.</b>
The methylene-blue reduction test has been used as a means of measuring
semen quality and is dependent on the metabolic activity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sperm. The effects of various freezing procedures on the ability of
samples to decolorize methylene blue were determined with 10 semen
samples. Sperm numbers were standardized to 300 &times; 10<span class="expon">6</span> cells per
milliliter and the time required for these cells to reduce a 1:40,000
solution of methylene blue was determined on freshly diluted semen,
after the addition of glycerol, after equilibration, and after freezing
and thawing. Portions of each diluted sample were tested at these
stages of the procedure with glycerol alone added and with glycerol
and various sugars added.</p>

<p>A marked increase in the time required for the sperm to reduce
methylene blue occurred when the glycerol was added (<a href="#Tab17">Table 17</a>).
This increase was greatest in the portions with glycerol alone and with
glycerol and glucose. The time increase was less pronounced in the
presence of the three pentose sugars used. Following equilibration, the
samples regained the ability to reduce methylene blue at a rate only
slightly slower than when they were fresh. Freezing and storage of
semen resulted in slower reduction of the methylene blue than was
shown after equilibration with glycerol. Since freezing usually kills
some of the sperm, a slowing of the reduction time after freezing
would be expected.</p>

<h2><a name="Ch10" id="Ch10"></a>PRACTICAL FREEZING PROCEDURE</h2>

<p>Good results usually can be obtained in freezing bull semen if care
is taken in collecting, diluting and processing the semen. Occasionally
the semen from certain bulls will not withstand freezing well. The
reason for this is not understood at present. However, carefully following
the directions and suggestions given below will usually produce
satisfactory results with semen samples that are of good quality
at the start.</p>

<p>Experience in the field has shown that fertility results with frozen
semen are usually slightly lower during the first few months than with
liquid semen stored at 5&deg; C. (41&deg; F.). Most units that have worked
with frozen semen over a period of a few months are able to improve
and do get fertility results as good as, or better than, obtained in their
liquid semen program.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_1" id="Sec10_1"></a><b>Collection of the semen.</b> In order to obtain the best possible semen
for freezing, care and cleanliness should be exercised in making the
collection. The artificial vagina, and the glassware used should be
clean and dry. The underline of the bull should also be clean and dry.
The bull should be restrained near the teaser cow for a minute or two
prior to collection in order to excite the flow of secretions prior to
ejaculation. Allowing the bull to mount the teaser once without serving
the artificial vagina is a good practice to use in properly stimulating
the bull before collection of the semen.</p>

<p>If the bull has not been used for three or four days, the collection
of a second ejaculate for freezing may be advisable. The second
ejaculate seems to withstand freezing better than the first in many
instances. A clean, dry artificial vagina should be used for each
ejaculate collected. Repeated collections in the same artificial vagina
may result in contamination of the semen with bacteria, lubricating
jelly and minute particles of dirt. The semen sample should be protected
from contamination and from sudden temperature drops (cold
shock).</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_2" id="Sec10_2"></a><b>Preparation of extender.</b> A suitable egg yolk-citrate extender for
freezing bull semen can be prepared by the following procedure. One
part egg yolk (free of egg white and the membrane surrounding the
yolk) is mixed with 4 parts 2.4 to 2.9 percent sodium citrate
dihydrate solution. The citrate is prepared with distilled water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
then boiled or autoclaved. The citrate solution should be cooled before
it is mixed with the egg yolk. After the egg and citrate are
mixed, 1000 units of penicillin and 1000 micrograms of streptomycin
are added per milliliter of extender. Sulfanilamide should not be added.
This extender can be prepared 12 to 24 hours before use if it is stored
at refrigerator temperature. The portion of the extender needed for the
original dilution of the semen should be warmed to room temperature
before it is mixed with the semen.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_3" id="Sec10_3"></a><b>Dilution after collection.</b> As soon as possible after collection, the
semen sample should be diluted with the extender. The extender must
be at the same temperature as the semen (room temperature) when
the two are mixed together. At this time the semen can be partially
diluted (1 part semen to 4 parts of extender) or diluted to a sperm
concentration twice the final desired concentration (later in adding the
glycerol for freezing, the semen is diluted further with an equal
volume of glycerol containing extender). The diluted semen is slowly
cooled (1<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> to
2<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> hours) to 5&deg; C. (41&deg; F.). Some units using frozen
semen now allow the semen to stand at 5&deg; C. for 5 to 6 hours before
glycerolization to allow the antibiotics to be more effective against any
vibrio fetus organisms that may be present. This step is taken because
it has been shown that glycerol inhibits the effectiveness of the antibiotics.<a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
After cooling, semen can be further diluted to twice the
desired sperm concentration if that were not done at the start.
(Caution: Be sure semen and diluent are at the same temperature.)</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_4" id="Sec10_4"></a><b>Adding the glycerol.</b> The glycerol solution is prepared by adding
14 volumes of glycerol (reagent grade) to 86 volumes of yolk-citrate
diluent (same as yolk-citrate used for original dilution). This solution
may be added dropwise with constant gentle mixing to the already
diluted semen, or one-third at a time at 10-minute intervals with
gentle mixing during each addition. Either method should take about
20 to 30 minutes. The total volume of glycerol-yolk-citrate solution
added should be equal to the volume of the original diluted semen.
In this way a concentration of 7 percent glycerol is obtained in the
final mixture that is to be frozen. Care must be taken to keep the
temperature at 5&deg; C. (41&deg; F.) during the time the glycerol is being
added. (A cold room is best for maintaining a temperature of 5&deg; C.,
but with care the operation can be carried out at room temperature by
using pans of ice water and a refrigerator.)</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_5" id="Sec10_5"></a><b>Equilibration.</b> The results
presented in this bulletin suggest that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
little or no time need be allowed after the glycerol is added before
freezing. However, results obtained by other workers show improved
fertility with at least 12 hours equilibration. Some units getting good
fertility results with frozen semen also are allowing the semen to
stand at 5&deg; C. for 12 to 18 hours before freezing. After the semen has
equilibrated with the glycerol, 1-milliliter portions of the mixture are
placed in 1.2- to 2-milliliter vials or ampules which are then sealed.
Ampuling can be done with an automatic syringe or pipette, provided
a large gage needle is used. Also, it is important not to force the
fluid mixture rapidly through the syringe or the sperm may be injured.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_6" id="Sec10_6"></a><b>Freezing.</b> The vials or ampules of diluted semen are placed in a
bath of isopropyl alcohol which has been cooled to 5&deg; C. (41&deg; F.).
This bath can be a wide-mouth thermos bottle or an insulated container
of almost any sort with a large opening at the top. The size
needed depends on the number of ampules being frozen. Some sort of
convenient tray for holding the ampules in an orderly fashion and
enabling the samples to be completely submerged is desirable. A few
ampules can be kept together easily by placing them in a polyethylene
freezer bag that has had many small holes cut in it to let the alcohol
of the bath contact the ampules. The ampules must be completely
covered by the alcohol to insure uniform cooling.</p>

<p>The alcohol of the bath and the ampules of semen are cooled by
adding chipped or ground dry ice in sufficient amounts to lower the
temperature of the bath 2&deg; C. (3.6&deg; F.) per minute from +5&deg; to -20&deg;
C. From -20&deg; down to -79&deg; C., the rate of cooling can be doubled
(4&deg; C. or 7.2&deg; F.). Electrical equipment that regulates the cooling rate
to the desired temperatures is available commercially, but the cost may
be too high for some small operations. The samples should be held at
-79&deg; C. (-110&deg; F.) until they are thawed. This can be done by
using an alcohol bath and dry ice or by special mechanical refrigerating
equipment. At no time prior to thawing should the samples be
exposed to warmer temperatures.</p>

<p><a name="Sec10_7" id="Sec10_7"></a><b>Thawing.</b> The ampules of frozen semen can be thawed by removing
them from the dry ice storage box and dropping them into a water
bath at 5&deg; C. (41&deg; F.). Thawing temperatures up to body temperature,
38&deg; C. (100&deg; F.), can be used but extreme care must then be taken
not to pass the semen through a cold inseminating tube; for this would
subject the sperm to cold shock. The semen should be used for breeding
within a few minutes after thawing.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
